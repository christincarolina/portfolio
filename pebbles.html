<p>
          Teens who are already parents are at the highest risk for unplanned pregnancy. They often face social isolation, stigma and mental health issues at higher rates than their peers. Pregnant and parenting teens face many barriers to enrolling, attending, and succeeding in school, such as discrimination, the challenge of juggling schoolwork with parenting responsibilities, and lack of access to child care, transportation, and other critical services.</p>

<br> <p> <b> Here are some key insights we found:</b> </br>

Young parents wants to break the stereotype that is imposed on them. <br>
Young parents are always juggling between providing for their children and their education (competing demands). <br>
​Young parents prioritize their child's future over their own personal growth.<br>
Young parents have to adjust to parenting life asap​.<br>
Young parents keep social media lives private​.<br>

              <p> Food assistance such as food stamps and WIC are federal programs for pregnant women and children up to age 5. However, it is only a short-term solution. Case managers are provided to the teen by school staff or through a community program and/or regular home visits during and after pregnancy, they serve to connect teens to medical and social services present in the community. A case manager meets with a teen parent a minimum of twice a month, either at home or at school.

It leads to this question: <b> What if I don't have a case manager? What happens? Who do I reach out for help?. </b> </p>

<h3> Persona </h3>
<p> Sophia is our <b> primary persona </b> because she has the most needs - She is at home taking care of her child while her partner is working part-time. She relies on need-based assistance and wants to be a self-sufficient mother. She doesn't have much financial support from family and because she only meets with her case manager twice a month, she needs to be looking for other resources to meet her other needs.  </p>


<p> Tyrone is our <b> secondary persona </b> as his needs are less urgent than Sophia's. Since his working hours are unstable, often times he would miss his daughter's milestones. He wants to be more involved in her child's day instead of getting limited updates from his partner. Scheduling changes may come in the way of unexpected situations. <p>

<p> <b> IDEA #1: Connect young parents to support groups that could provide basic necessities according to their children's age. </b><br> 
<b> PROS: </b> This idea would inform young parents availability of resources nearest to their location <br>

<b> Why it didn't work: </b> We assumed diapers were given for free within a certain amount. However, what we learned was Individual institutions have their own set of rules in order to get supplies. For example, 10hrs of volunteer work is accumulated into points, which is then calculated and can be redeemed as diapers (for eg.) Also, it is not in the user's mental model to track their resources.

</p>


<img class="picture" src="images/idea1.png" alt="x">


<p> <b> IDEA #2: Reaching a goal as co-parents</b><br> 
<b> PROS: </b> This idea would keep young parents accountable and have a shared responsibility of purchasing a need that they share (eg. buying a stroller) <br>

<b> Why it didn't work: </b> This idea touches the topic of money which is a sensitive topic, and can be unfair when the individual does not have any income.There is uncertainty in how much money is earned by both parents.


</p>


<img class="picture" src="images/idea2.png" alt="x">


<p> <b> IDEA #3: Connect young parents to other young parents for support</b><br> 
<b> PROS: </b> This idea would keep young parents accountable and have a shared responsibility of purchasing a need that they share (eg. buying a stroller) <br>

<b> Why it didn't work: </b> Young parents don't have the time to "chat" nor talk to other young parents. They have dire need which is to prioritize where to get basic resources for her child.

<h3> Takeaways </h3>
<p> When asking questions to the young parents, it is important to be mindful about how we frame the questions. We need to empathize how these young parents are feeling and how hard it must be for them to open up when it is a sensitive topic.</p>
