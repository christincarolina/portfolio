<h3> How Pebbles help teen parents </h3>

<p> Pebbles alleviate the challenges of being a young parent and a teenager through the support of mentors, access to basic resources, and scheduling changes with their partner. I worked with three teammates to discover problems, research and brainstorming sessions. I worked on the design and further iterations of the project. </p>

        <h1 class="mb-30">User Research  </h1>
<h3> Formulating assumptions </h3>
<p> Through affinity mapping, we assumed young parents have different levels of support and different levels of knowledge. A young parent's knowledge is based on the knowledge they received. Creating segmentations of our users allowed us to create patterns of similar behaviors. </p>

              <p> What if we can provide a platform for users to connect with like-minded individuals who have similar interests and have gone to the places we want to go to? Wouldn't it eradicate the time to plan? </p>

<img class="picture" src="images/123.png" alt="x">


<h3> Focus Groups </h3>
<p> To test some of our assumptions we had as a team, we met with....We knew if we truly wanted to understand our young parents we needed to meet them, talk to them and spend time with them. We interviewed 4 participants in-person. </p>

<img class="picture" src="images/pebbles_pic.png" alt="x">


<h3> User Interviews </h3>

<p> To understand how students use the current MyBYUI portal,   the UX researcher and I conducted guerilla user interviews with 22 students. During the interviews, I asked questions like "Tell me about your experience using the MyBYUI portal", "What are important tasks you perform on MyBYUI?", "If MyBYUI could streamline any information to you, what would that information be?", and "What are needs you have as a student that MyBYUI is not fulfilling?"

<br>

<br> <b> Here are some key insights we found:</b> </br>

Young parents wants to break the stereotype that is imposed on them. <br>
Young parents are always juggling between providing for their children and their education. <br>
​Young parents prioritize their child's future over their own personal growth.<br>
Young parents have to adjust to parenting life asap​.<br>
Young parents keep social media lives private​.<br>

<h1 class="mb-30"> Key Quotes  </h1>

<h2> <i> “How did it happen, how did you do it? How are you doing now?" -- I would have wanted to be asked "How did you overcome it?" </i>

<br>
​

<i> "I don't want to be another statistic." </i>

<br> 
“Financially, it was really hard because I had to make tough decisions between buying diapers and buying a book for a specific class.”

<h3> Persona </h3>

<p> After collecting insights from the user interviews, our team created two personas. The first persona is focused on a upper-class student who needs to save time and be aware of important deadlines. The second persona is focused on a freshman student who is looking for rescources that the campus provides. </p>

<h3> Storyboards </h3>
<p> Storyboards help us visualize scenarios the user is engaged in, the problems faced and helps us understand how our solution will help the user have a better experience.  </p>
